# Tableau-US-Birth-Rate-in-California


1.	Project Description: 
Birth Variables and Covid-19 Impact: California Birth Statistics 2019 – 2020
In this project, we are analyzing the birth rate of California counties during 2019 & 2020. We are trying to see if there is a “baby bust” during Covid.

2.	Objective: Why are you visualizing this? 
We wanted to investigate if the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic had any effects on the birth rate of California by analyzing pre-pandemic and pandemic data. Using the many variables we have at our disposal, we also will investigate if the age, race, and education level, and other variables of mothers and birth data affected the birth rates during the COVID-19 pandemic. Were certain education levels not having children or having children at a lower level? Why? 

3.	Hypothesis: At least 5 hypotheses explaining the phenomenon of data that is considered in your proposed DV project. 
Hypothesis 1: Whether mothers in age group of 25-34 gave more births as compared to mothers of age group 35-44 in California Counties.

Hypothesis 2: Did mothers with higher degrees (bachelor’s degree and above) have less births than mothers with no college degree. (High school degree and lower) in California Counties.

Hypothesis 3: Whether the birth rate among white mothers decreased the most when compared with the other ethnicities in California during the pandemic.

Hypothesis 4: Whether the birth rate in California counties had an overall decrease in 2020 when compared to 2019 due to Covid.

Hypothesis 5: Whether San Francisco is more likely to have higher birth rate because of its higher population density.
